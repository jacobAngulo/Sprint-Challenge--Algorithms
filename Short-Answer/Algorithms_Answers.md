`b. O(n)`


`c. O(c^n)`

### excersise 2

`I would use a binary search that would give me a runtime complexity of O(log(n)) I would do this by sorting the given array of floors and testing whether or not the egg would break if I dropped it from the middle floor, if it did, I would run the same test on all the lower floors recursively untill I found the floor and the opposite, if the agg did not break I would run the test on all the higher floors`
